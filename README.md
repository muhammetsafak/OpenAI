# OpenAI

This library was created to facilitate communication with OpenAI services in the simplest and most understandable way using PHP.

### Installation

```
composer require muhammetsafak/openai-client
```

### Required

- PHP 7.4 or later
- cURL Extension

## Usage

### Completions

```php
use MuhammetSafak\OpenAI\OpenAI;
use MuhammetSafak\OpenAI\Services\Completions;
const SECRET_KEY = "";

$openai = new OpenAI(SECRET_KEY);
$openai->setPrompt($_GET['prompt'])
    ->setTemperature(0.7);

$res = (new Completions($openai))->get();

echo $res['response']['choices'][0]['text'];
```

The exact equivalent of the `$res` variable should be something similar to the following.

```php
[
    'status'        => true,
    'message'       => '',
    'response'      => [
        "id" => "cmpl-8WlS2x6looAGlj8Z182D3M...",
        "object" => "text_completion",
        "created" => 1702819590,
        "model" => "davinci-002",
        "choices" => [
            0 => [

                "index" => 0,
                "logprobs" => null,
                "finish_reason" => "stop",
            ],
        ],
        "usage" => [
                "prompt_tokens" => 1,
                "completion_tokens" => 81,
                "total_tokens" => 32,
        ],
    ]
]
```

### Chat

```php
use MuhammetSafak\OpenAI\OpenAI;
use MuhammetSafak\OpenAI\Services\Chat;
const SECRET_KEY = "";

$openai = new OpenAI(SECRET_KEY);
$openai->setPrompt($systemMessage)
    ->setTemperature(0.7);
    
$res = (new Chat($openai))
    ->setUserMessage($userMessage)
    ->get();

echo $res['response']['choices'][0]['message']['content'];
```

The exact equivalent of the `$res` variable should be something similar to the following.

```php
[
    'status'        => true,
    'message'       => '',
    'response'      => [

                "message" => [
                    "role" => "assistant",
                    "content" => "",
                ],
                "logprobs" => null,
                "finish_reason" => "stop",
            ],
        ],
        "usage" => [
                "prompt_tokens" => 121,
